# Literature Review

Radiative transfer, the propagation of electromagnetic radiation through transparent or participating media, plays a crucial role in fields ranging from atmospheric physics to industrial heat transfer.
Traditional approaches to solving the radiative transfer equation (RTE) have relied heavily on numerical methods or simplified analytical solutions for specific geometries and boundary conditions.

This book introduces a novel perspective: **graph equilibrium methods for radiative transfer**. By recasting radiative transfer problems as equilibrium problems on graphs, new analytical pathways are unlocked and computational accuracies previously infeasible become readily available.

## The Traditional Challenge

Radiative transfer in participating media is a fundamental process in many natural and engineered systems, from stellar atmospheres to thermal engineering.
The theoretical foundation for radiative transfer was established in the 19th century by Gustav Kirchhoff, who formulated the fundamental relationship between emission and absorption of thermal radiation and introduced the concept of blackbody radiation [@Kirchhoff1860].
Building upon this work, Karl Schwarzschild developed early formulations for radiative transfer in stellar atmospheres in the early 1900s [@Schwarzschild1906].
The modern mathematical framework of the radiative transfer equation (RTE) was systematically developed by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in his seminal 1950 treatise "Radiative Transfer," [@Chandrasekhar1950] which provided rigorous analytical methods and established the equation as the cornerstone of radiation transport theory across diverse fields from astrophysics to engineering applications.

Despite this rich theoretical heritage, the fundamental governing equation remains a challenging integro-differential equation in seven independent variables: Three spatial coordinates ($x$, $y$, $z$), two directional angles ($\theta$, $\phi$), one spectral wavelength ($\lambda$) and one temporal time ($t$).
Under steady-state and grey media assumptions, the temporal ($t$) and spectral ($\lambda$) dependencies are eliminated, reducing the RTE from seven to five independent variables, which yields the differential form shown in equation (@eq-rte) [@Howell2021]:

$$ \frac{\partial i(S,\Omega)}{\partial S} = \; \kappa i_\mathrm{b}(S) - \kappa i(S,\Omega) - \sigma_\mathrm{s} i(S,\Omega) + \frac{\sigma_\mathrm{s}}{4 \pi} \int_{\Omega_i=4 \pi}i(S,\Omega_i) \Phi(\Omega_i,\Omega) d\Omega_i $$ {#eq-rte}

where $i(S,\Omega)$ is the intensity along a ray trajectory, as a function of position $S$ and direction $\Omega\equiv\Omega(\theta,\phi)$, $\kappa$ is the absorption coefficient of the medium, $i_\mathrm{b}(S)$ is the blackbody intensity, $\sigma_\mathrm{s}$ is the scattering coefficient and $\Phi$ is the scattering phase function and the integral is over all solid angles.

The RTE of equation (@eq-rte) is a differential energy balance along the trajectory $S$ of a single ray.
To solve it one could, in principle, simply integrate along the ray trajectory.
What makes the RTE particularly challenging to solve for general geometries is that all possible ray trajectories in the domain are coupled through two mechanisms:
(1) The state of the participating medium, i.e. the temperature of the intervening gas, which depends on the local radiative heating rate and governs both the rate of emission (through blackbody emission laws) and temperature-dependent absorption properties, and
(2) the in-scattering term, which requires integration over all incoming directions (4$\pi$ steradians) to account for radiation scattered from every direction into the direction of $S$.
Therefore, for general geometries, to determine the equilibrium state, all possible ray trajectories must be solved simultaneously, which explains why the RTE has historically resisted general analytical treatment, and is most commonly solved numerically, or through analytical solutions for special simplified cases [@Howell2021].

As noted by Modest and Mazumder [@ModestMazumder2022] in their most recent textbook:
<div class="quote-box">
<strong>Modest and Mazumder (2022):</strong> "... to this day no truly satisfactory RTE solution method has emerged."
</div>

The RTE does not directly account for surface reflections, and therefore the exchange factor transformation presented here may be thought of as a generalized analytical solution of the RTE.

## Existing Matrix-based Methods

Seeking to quantify combustion heat transfer, Hottel and co-workers [@HottelCohen1958][@HottelSarofim1967][@Noble1975] pioneered solutions to the RTE using a discretized integral approach. Fundamentally, this integral approach produces matrices of *exchange areas*, which describe the radiative connectivity of the discretized domain. The integrals for the exchange areas are:

Surface-surface:
$$ \overline{s_j s_k} = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{A_j}\int_{A_k} \frac{\overline{t}(S_{j-k})\mathrm{cos}(\theta_j)\mathrm{cos}(\theta_k)}{S^2_{j-k}}dA_k dA_j $$

Surface-gas and gas-surface:
$$ \overline{s_k g_\gamma} = \overline{g_\gamma s_k} = \frac{\kappa}{\pi} \int_{V_\gamma}\int_{A_k}\frac{\overline{t}(S_{k-\gamma}) \mathrm{cos}(\theta_k)}{S^2_{k-\gamma}} dA_k dV_\gamma $$

Gas-gas:
$$ \overline{g_\gamma g_{\gamma*}} = \frac{\kappa^2}{\pi} \int_{V_\gamma}\int_{V_{\gamma*}} \frac{\overline{t}(S_{\gamma-\gamma*})}{S^2_{\gamma-\gamma*}}dV_{\gamma*} dV_\gamma $$

where $\overline{t}=\mathrm{exp}(-\kappa S)$ is the transmissivity of the participating medium, $\theta$ is the angle with the surface normal, $\mathrm{cos}(\theta)$ of the emitter surface accounts for the diffuse Lambertian emission and $\mathrm{cos}(\theta)$ of the absorbing surface accounts for the projected area effect, $S$ is the distance from the point of emission to the point of absorption and $\kappa$ is the absorption coefficient of the medium. These integrals, being analytically intractable, were initially, before the general advent of modern day digital computers, solved graphically and tabulated. Once the exchange areas have been determined for all pairs of emitters and absorbers in the system, subsequent solution of the RTE is achieved using linear algebra.

Prior to this period, having access to some of the first computational resources, Stanislav Ulam and co-workers  pioneered the Monte Carlo method [@MetropolisUlam1949], a statistical method that can model complex phenomena which are analytically intractable. Not surprisingly, Monte Carlo methods can be applied to solve the multi-dimensional integrals formulated by Hottel and co-workers.
