# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book presents a novel approach to solving radiative transfer equations using graph equilibrium methods. The work develops analytical solutions through a groundbreaking graph-based framework that extends beyond traditional radiative transfer applications.

## Overview

Radiative transfer problems have traditionally been approached through numerical methods or simplified analytical solutions. This book introduces a fundamentally different perspective: treating radiative transfer as a graph equilibrium problem. This approach not only provides new analytical insights but also opens pathways to solving previously intractable problems.

The methods presented here are implemented in Julia, with all code available in the companion package `RayTraceHeatTransfer.jl`.

## Who This Book Is For

This book is intended for:

- Researchers in radiative transfer and heat transfer
- Computational physicists working with transport phenomena  
- Applied mathematicians interested in graph theory applications
- Graduate students in physics, engineering, or applied mathematics
- Anyone interested in novel analytical approaches to complex physical systems

## Prerequisites

Readers should have:

- Undergraduate-level physics and mathematics
- Familiarity with differential equations
- Basic knowledge of radiative transfer concepts (helpful but not required)
- Some programming experience (Julia examples are provided)

## How to Use This Book

Each chapter builds upon previous concepts, but experienced readers may skip to specific topics of interest. All mathematical derivations are presented in full, and computational examples accompany theoretical developments.

Code examples can be run interactively, and the complete source for this book is available at: [github.com/NikoBiele/graph-equilibrium-radiative-transfer](https://github.com/NikoBiele/graph-equilibrium-radiative-transfer)
