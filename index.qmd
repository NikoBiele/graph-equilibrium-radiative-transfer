This book presents a novel approach to solving the radiative transfer equation (RTE) using novel graph equilibrium methods. The work develops analytical solutions through a graph-based framework that extends beyond traditional radiative transfer applications.

## Overview

Radiative transfer problems have traditionally been approached through numerical methods or simplified analytical solutions. This book introduces a fundamentally different perspective: treating radiative transfer as a graph equilibrium problem. This approach not only provides new analytical insights but also opens pathways to solving previously intractable problems with analytical accuracy.

The methods presented here are implemented in Julia, where all code will be made available in the companion registered package `RayTraceHeatTransfer.jl`.

## Who This Book Is For

This book is intended for:

- Researchers in radiative transfer and heat transfer
- Computational physicists working with transport phenomena  
- Applied mathematicians interested in graph theory applications
- Graduate students in physics, engineering, or applied mathematics
- Anyone interested in novel analytical approaches to complex physical systems

## Prerequisites

Readers should have:

- Undergraduate-level physics and mathematics
- Familiarity with linear algebra
- Basic knowledge of radiative transfer concepts
- Some programming experience (Julia examples are provided)

## How to Use This Book

The first part of this book will function as a high level tutorial for the companion registered Julia package `RayTraceHeatTransfer.jl`.

The latter part of this book will present background mathematical derivations, theorems and proofs in full, to support and validate the computational examples from the first part of the book.

Code examples are called directly from the companion registered Julia package `RayTraceHeatTransfer.jl`.
