This book presents novel analytic algorithms for solving general graph equilibrium problems exactly, including those on directed graphs.
To thoroughly validate these novel approaches, they are applied to the special case of solving the notoriously difficult radiative transfer equation (RTE), which describe physical radiation transport in absorbing, emitting and scattering media.
The work develops analytical solutions to the RTE through the graph-based framework which extends beyond traditional radiative transfer applications.

## Overview

Radiative transfer problems have traditionally been approached through numerical, hybrid or simplified analytical methods.
This book presents a novel approach, which is analytic at its core, allowing its correctness to be mathematically proven.
While this novel approach is analytic, it requires as an input the geometric visibility of the domain.
In the case of a convex domain with a transparent medium, the visibility matrix of the domain can be obtained analytically, producing an entirely analytical solution.
For non-convex domains with non-transparent media yielding non-zero attenuation, the visibility matrix can in general not be obtained analytically.
For this case, the visibility matrix is found numerically through ray tracing, which in total results in a hybrid approach to solving the RTE.
The methods presented here are implemented in Julia, and all code will be made available in the companion registered package `RayTraceHeatTransfer.jl`.

## Who This Book Is For

This book is intended for:

- Researchers in radiative transfer and heat transfer
- Computational physicists working with transport phenomena  
- Applied mathematicians interested in graph theory applications
- Graduate students in physics, engineering, or applied mathematics
- Anyone interested in novel analytical approaches to complex physical systems

## Prerequisites

Readers should have:

- Undergraduate-level physics and mathematics
- Familiarity with linear algebra
- Basic knowledge of radiative transfer concepts
- Some programming experience (Julia examples are provided)

## How to Use This Book

The first part of this book will function as a high level tutorial for the companion registered Julia package `RayTraceHeatTransfer.jl`.

The second part of this book will present background mathematical derivations, theorems and proofs in full, to support and validate the computational examples from the first part of the book.

The third part of this book will expand on the more general applications, beyond the special case of radiative transfer.

Code examples are called directly from the companion registered Julia package `RayTraceHeatTransfer.jl`.
