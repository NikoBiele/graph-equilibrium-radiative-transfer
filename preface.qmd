# Preface {.unnumbered}

## Who This Book Is For

This book is intended for:

- Researchers in radiative transfer and heat transfer
- Computational physicists working with transport phenomena  
- Applied mathematicians interested in graph theory applications
- Engineers and industry practitioners seeking rigorous validation methods for radiative transfer codes
- Graduate students in physics, engineering, or applied mathematics

## Prerequisites

Readers should have:

- Undergraduate-level physics and mathematics
- Familiarity with linear algebra
- Basic knowledge of radiative transfer concepts
- Some programming experience (Julia examples are provided, but programming knowledge isn't required to understand concepts)

## How to Use This Book

This book is structured to accommodate different learning styles and needs.
Each part covering novel concepts follows a consistent pattern: concepts → examples → validation → proofs.
This allows readers to engage at their preferred level of detail:

- Practical readers can focus on concepts, examples, and validation results
- Theoretical readers can dive into the full mathematical proofs
- All readers benefit from seeing working code examples that demonstrate applications

## Julia Implementation

All methods are implemented in Julia [@Bezanson2017Julia], chosen for its mathematical notation that mirrors theoretical development, high-performance capabilities, and excellent scientific computing ecosystem.

To get started:

Install [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and optionally [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Julia extension](https://www.julia-vscode.org/).
To add the package of this book, inside Julia, run:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("RayTraceHeatTransfer")
using RayTraceHeatTransfer
```

## Acknowledgments

## Declaration of Generative AI and AI-assisted Technologies in this Research.

Throughout the process which lead to this book, Anthropic's Claude models have contributed several key insights.
After using these tools/services, I have reviewed, extensively tested and validated all claims put forth and I take full responsibility for the content of this book.
